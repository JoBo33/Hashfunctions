# Hashfunctions

## Definition "Hashfunction"

Simply said hash functions creates with help of a given input an abstract output wich can be used in the background. The output is called hash values. Furthermore, hash functions are "one-way-functions". That means you can get the output with help of the input but you will not get the input if you just have the output. One example why hash functions are very usefull is saving passwords. It is typical that (for example websites) store the hash values of your password and not the "real" password because if the website is being hacked the hackers get the hash values of passwords and not the real passwords. Due to the "one-way-functions" they can not get the "real" passwords.
