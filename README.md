# Hashfunctions

## Definition "Hashfunction"

Simply said hash functions creates with help of a given input an abstract output wich can be used in the background. The output is called hash values. Furthermore, hash functions are "one-way-functions". That means you can get the output with help of the input but you will not get the input if you just have the output. One example why hash functions are very usefull is saving passwords. It is typical that (for example websites) store the hash values of your password and not the "real" password because if the website is being hacked the hackers get the hash values of passwords and not the real passwords. Due to the "one-way-functions" they can not get the "real" passwords.

## GUI-concept

On the top is on the one hand a combo box to choose the algorithm you would like to use and an the other hand the generate button to get the specific hash values. On the buttom you can use the textbox on the left side for the input and on the right side you can see the the hash values after pushing the generate button.
